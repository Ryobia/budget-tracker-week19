## Description 
  This project was meant as practice for converting a functional website into a PWA. To do so I added indexedDB functionality as well as a service worker so that the app would be just as useful offline as it is online. The code allows for the app to store data that the user enters and locally it works the same whether you're online or offline. Once an internet connection is established then the app connects to the database and saves whatever was entered while offline. Finally, in order to make it a PWA I added a manifest.json file.
